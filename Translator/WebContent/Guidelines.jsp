<br><u><h1 align="center">Translation Guidelines</h1></u>
	<p>
You will be provided with tweets in English (or Irish) related to the 2016 General Election, and you are asked to provide as close a translation into Irish (or English) as possible. Your contributions will be used to benefit research into Irish Machine Translation and sentiment analysis of social media content.
<br><br>
Please enter the translations in the blank text box provided. 
<br><br>
Below are some tips to guide you during translation; please read these before you start:
<br>
<h4>Placeholders:</h4>
#hashtags and @twitterhandles are to be left untranslated. Emoticons have been replaced by the placeholder [emoticon], please retain these placeholders in your Irish translation (or English translations) also, e.g. 
<br>
<i>My Dad [emoticon] soaked but smiling #ge16 →</i><br>
<i>M’athair [emoticon] fliuch báite ach fós gealgháireach #ge16</i>

<h4>Case:</h4>
Please keep translations case sensitive where possible, e.g.:</br>
<i> FULL HOUSE Great night tonight @SorchaNicC #GE16 launch. → </i> </br>
<i>TEACH LÁN Oíche iontach anocht ag seol #GE16 @SorchaNicC.</i>
<br>
<h4>Text speak:</h4>
Where possible, please translate English text speak to Irish text speak (and vice versa), where there are equivalents, e.g. tnx (thanks) → grma (go raibh maith agat). 
If there is no shortened Irish/English equivalent that you are aware of, translate the word into its full form.
<br>
<h4>Tweet length:</h4>
Although the English tweets have been limited to 140 characters, your Irish translations do not have adhere to this.

<br>
<h4>Pre-translate options:</h4>
It's fine to use Google translate to pre-translate the tweets and correct the output - if you find it helpful. If it's too much of a hindrance, translation from scratch might work better.
Note that the translations do not have to be 100% sound. Remember that the quality of Twitter language is questionable at the best of times, so your best shot is enough. Where there is ambiguity, go with your intuitive translation
<br>
<h4>Confidence level:</h4>
After having translated the tweet, you are asked to indicate how confident you are that your translation is accurate. Please rate your translation on a scale of 1-10 from the drop-down menu provided.
